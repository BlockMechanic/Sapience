Our interest with the Sapience AIFX project is to develop a distributed artificial intelligence system running on a coin network, with a primary initial goal of enabling neural network services to be consumed by both users and systems, specifically the Quotient  (XQN) algorithmic trading interface, and a longer term goal of applying AGI through knowledge gathering and machine learning.
